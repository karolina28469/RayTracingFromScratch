## About the project
Project implements raytracing algorithm from scatch. It includes a virtual three-dimensional scene containing various textured objects. To make these objects more realistic all of them have some special effect which imitate different surface finish such as: matte, shiny, slightly glossy and mirror effect. Additionaly several light sources were created, to add more depth and dimension to the space. Every scene is rendered using the raytracing technique.
